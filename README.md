# EnriquezLibrary
2/28/2024:
As of last week I had the holding, book, and periodical finished.
As I am checking the work today to finish up before submitting for
grading I noticed that my code is not running and instead of having
an option to run and build my code I only have the option to attach 
so I may have to move the code over to another file and fix that error.

THe purpose of this program is to try and replicate a library in order
to gain a better understanding of inheritiance, polymorphism and ownership.
